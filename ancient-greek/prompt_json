Hello! 

I would like to practice my ancient greek
vocabulary.  

Please help me generate a vocabulary list
centered around the topic: "volcanoes"

The vocabulary words should be specific, useful,
varied, and directly related to the topic.

I would like you to generate 40 json values of the
following format:

{
    "ancient_greek_word":  xxx, # written in ancient greek characters, lower cased
    "english_spelling":    xxx,   
    "english_translation": xxx,
    "pronunciation":       xxx, # phonetic spelling of the ancient greek word, make sure it is quoted
    "part_of_speech":      xxx,
    "gender":              xxx,
    "definition":          xxx,
    "etymology":           xxx,

    #this is an example sentence
    "example": [
        <ancient-greek-example-sentence>,
        <english-spelling-of-the-ancient-greek-example-sentence>,
        <translation-into-english-of-the-ancient-greek-example-sentence>,
    }
}

We have already seen the following words and should not repeat them:
ψυχή
