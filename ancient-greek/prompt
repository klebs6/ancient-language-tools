Hello! 

I would like to practice my ancient greek
vocabulary.  

Please help me generate a vocabulary list
centered around the topic: "geology"

The vocabulary words should be specific, useful,
varied, and directly related to the topic.

I would like you to generate 40 yaml values of the
following format:

```
<item-number>. <lowercase_ancient_greek_word> -- <english-spelling> -- <english-translation>
<pronunciation>, <part-of-speech>, <gender>

<definition>
<etymology>

<connotations>
<collocations>

<word-families>

<synonyms-and-antonyms>

<ancient-greek-example-sentence-with-english-spelling-and-translation>
<the-english-spelling-of-the-ancient-greek-example-sentence>
<the-translation-into-english-of-the-ancient-greek-example-sentence>
```

We don't need to add any annotations to the result.  

I know where each field is and can parse it myself.  

Newlines and spacing should be preserved, as should the relative order of fields.

We have already seen the following words and should not repeat them:
πυρ
