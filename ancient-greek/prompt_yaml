Hello! 

I would like to practice my ancient greek
vocabulary.  

Please help me generate a vocabulary list
centered around the topic: "volcanoes"

The vocabulary words should be specific, useful,
varied, and directly related to the topic.

I would like you to generate 40 yaml values of the
following format:

lowercase_ancient_greek_word:
    - <english-spelling>
    - <english-translation>
    - <pronunciation>
    - <part-of-speech>
    - <gender>
    - <definition>
    - <etymology>
    example:
        - <ancient-greek-example-sentence>
        - <english-spelling-of-the-ancient-greek-example-sentence>
        - <translation-into-english-of-the-ancient-greek-example-sentence>

We have already seen the following words and should not repeat them:
ψυχή
